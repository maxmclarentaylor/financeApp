This is a simple application created usng the Create React App Library.

After installing, to run the app hit: npm run start 

The site will run on http://localhost:3000/ 

Overview:

This application is a simple allowance calculator. 

I created it soley to demo my knowledge of React, Redux and Javascript, but if needs be I will expand it in the future.

This is why currently there are sections of the code (e.g. the items that can be chosen via bring items back) that have not been completed. 

I mention this as I began work on them in both Redux and React (this also explains why some simple warnings remain in the code, although some I have chosen to ignore for good reason)

As the aim of this was to showcase my React, Redux and Js abilities, I did not focus on styling at all and only gave a limited time to UX. 

Instructions:

If you click on add a goal you can create as many goals as you like.

After creating a goal you have the ability to type in your achievement and then save your result.

You can then create a goal reward by clicking on the plus sign.

This allows you to decide how much money you can spend based off your achievements.

The pass/failure of goals rewards will update based on the changes to the goals.

The highest successful reward will always be the value seen under Current Spending Allowance.

If you remove a goal, all goal rewards that contain that goal will be removed. 

You cannot add the same goal reward twice. 

You cannot add a goal reward for a goal that does not exist.
